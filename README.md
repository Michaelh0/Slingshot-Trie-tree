# Slingshot Trie tree
Test for Data Structure and Algorithms Assessment

Disclaimer: My family and I had Covid-19 during the time period of my testing. I tried my best to complete everything that you asked for. 

How the server is hosted.
The service is hosted through AWS.
The public link to the server is http://13.57.39.149/. 
I learned AWS this weekend to accommodate the project requirements. 

How the CLI interacts with it
I made a website instead for the users to interact with the trie data structure.

I believe the server to my website works only on the local level. 

Regarding the functions within in the js folder, I used https://www.30secondsofcode.org/articles/s/js-data-structures-tree as a basis for the structure of a general tree.

In addition, I used their postTraversal, preTraversal, has, and find functions within the tree function. The while loop of the travelling of the tree is the same for any tree, so I found that there was some overlap there. 


Thank you for considering my project.

Enjoy the website.
